# camt053

Set of deserializable structs for the [ISO 20022](https://www.iso20022.org)
camt.053.001.02 "Bank to Customer Statement" message format, for use with
Serde and preferably an XML parsing library.

## Credits

I've used significant portions of [xkikeg](https://github.com/xkikeg)'s
[okane](https://github.com/xkikeg/okane) project and continued building
on existing structs to make it work with kash.
